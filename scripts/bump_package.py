"""Bump a gem's version via an auto-merging PR.

Ported from python-sdk's post-fix pipeline. Compatible with branch-protection
rulesets that require all changes to land through PRs and require commits to be
signed:

0. If the configured version already has a merged bump commit on the target
   branch but no release tag (a prior run's merge-wait timed out before
   tagging), the missing tag is pushed and the run stops. Re-running cz in that
   state would double-bump.
1. ``cz bump --files-only`` updates ``.cz.toml`` (the cz version field),
   ``lib/keycardai/<gem>/version.rb`` and ``CHANGELOG.md`` in the gem
   directory; no local commit or tag.
2. A release-line-specific bump branch is created on the remote at the current
   target-branch tip via the REST refs API.
3. The bumped files are committed onto that branch via the GraphQL
   ``createCommitOnBranch`` mutation, which GitHub signs as the app. No GPG key
   is involved.
4. A PR is opened with auto-merge armed. Once its checks are green the script
   merges it directly: the release app is a ruleset bypass actor, and
   auto-merge never exercises bypass, it only fires when every requirement
   (including required reviews) is genuinely satisfied. Arming auto-merge and
   waiting is what deadlocked python-sdk and typescript-sdk in July 2026.
   Auto-merge stays armed as the fallback if the direct merge is refused.
5. The script polls until the PR merges, captures the squash-merge SHA on the
   target branch, then creates the ``<version>-<gem-name>`` tag at that SHA.
   Tags trigger release.yml, which publishes to rubygems.org.

The runner needs ``GH_TOKEN`` in env (the release app's installation token) and
a repo with auto-merge enabled and squash merging available.
